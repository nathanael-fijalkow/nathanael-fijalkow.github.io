<h2>
Finding LaBRI (and my office!)
</h2>

<br/><br/>

In all cases you end up at the bus and tram station called Peixotto. 
From there: enter the campus (there is a fence with a door next to the tram stop), and look for building A30 (LaBRI) on this map: (the Peixotto tram stop is on the bottom right, "entrée")

<br/>
Once you found LaBRI, enter through the main gates. There are stairs to your left, take them, you will see a reception ("accueil").
Ask to call me. Unfortunately you cannot access (without a special badge) the second floor where my office is (number 268, next to the elevator).
