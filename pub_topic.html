In this paper, we give a self contained presentation of a recent breakthrough in the theory of infinite duration games: the existence of a quasipolynomial time algorithm for solving parity games. 
We introduce for this purpose two new notions: good for small games automata and universal graphs.
<br/>
The first object, good for small games automata, induces a generic algorithm for solving games by reduction to safety games. We show that it is in a strong sense equivalent to the second object, universal graphs, which is a combinatorial notion easier to reason with. Our equivalence result is very generic in that it holds for all existential memoryless winning conditions, not only for parity conditions.

Several distinct techniques have been proposed to design quasi-polynomial algorithms for solving parity games since the breakthrough result of Calude, Jain, Khoussainov, Li, and Stephan (2017): play summaries, progress measures and register games. We argue that all those techniques can be viewed as instances of the separation approach to solving parity games, a key technical component of which is constructing (explicitly or implicitly) an automaton that separates languages of words encoding plays that are (decisively) won by either of the two players. Our main technical result is a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of such separating automata that nearly matches the current best upper bounds. This forms a barrier that all existing approaches must overcome in the ongoing quest for a polynomial-time algorithm for solving parity games. The key and fundamental concept that we introduce and study is a universal ordered tree. The technical highlights are a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of universal ordered trees and a proof that every separating safety automaton has a universal tree hidden in its state space.

                                        <i>We consider two-player games over graphs and give tight bounds on the memory size of strategies ensuring safety conditions. 
                                        More specifically, we show that the minimal number of memory states of a strategy ensuring a safety condition is given by 
                                        the size of the maximal antichain of left quotients with respect to language inclusion. 
                                        This result holds for all safety conditions without any regularity assumptions, and for all (finite or infinite) graphs of finite degree.

                                        We give several applications of this general principle. In particular, we characterize the exact memory requirements

                                        In this paper, we consider two-player zero-sum games with generalized reachability objectives, defined as conjunctions of reachability objectives. 
                                        We first prove that deciding the winner in such games is PSPACE-complete, although it is fixed-parameter tractable with 
                                        the number of reachability objectives as parameter. Moreover, we consider the memory requirements for both players and give 
                                        matching upper and lower bounds on the size of winning strategies. 
                                        In order to construct more efficient algorithms, we consider subclasses of generalized reachability games.

                                        <i>Games on graphs provide a natural model for reactive non-terminating systems. 
                                        In such games, the interaction of two players on an arena results in an infinite path that describes a run of the system. 
                                        Different settings are used to model various open systems in computer science, as for instance turn-based or concurrent moves, 
                                        and deterministic or stochastic transitions. 
                                        In this paper, we are interested in turn-based games, and specifically in deterministic parity games and stochastic reachability games

                                        <i>We study two-player zero-sum games over infinite-state graphs equipped with finitary conditions. 
                                        Such conditions refine the classical omega-regular conditions: instead of requiring that good events occur infinitely often, 
                                        they ensure the existence of a bound B such that in the limit good events occur within B steps.

                                        Our first contribution is to give (non-effective) characterizations of the winning regions for finitary games over countably infinite-state graphs. 
                                        From these results we obtain the strategy complexity, i.e the memory required for winning strategies: 
                                        we prove that memoryless strategies are sufficient for finitary Buchi, and finite memory suffices for finitary parity.

                                        We then study pushdown games with finitary conditions, with two contributions. 
                                        First we prove a collapse result for pushdown games with finitary conditions, implying the decidability of solving these games. 
                                        Second we consider pushdown games with finitary parity along with stack boundedness conditions, and show that solving these games is EXPTIME-complete.

Probabilistic automata are a computational model introduced by
Michael Rabin, extending nondeterministic finite automata with
probabilistic transitions.  Despite its simplicity, this model is
very expressive and many of the associated algorithmic questions are
undecidable.  In this work we focus on the emptiness problem, which
asks whether a given probabilistic automaton accepts some word with
probability higher than a given threshold.  We consider a natural
and well-studied structural restriction on automata, namely the
degree of ambiguity, which is defined as the maximum number of
accepting runs over all words.  We observe that undecidability of
the emptiness problem requires infinite ambiguity and so we focus on
the case of finitely ambiguous probabilistic automata.
<br/>
Our main results are to construct efficient algorithms for analysing
finitely ambiguous probabilistic automata through a reduction to a
multi-objective optimisation problem, called the stochastic path
problem.  We obtain a polynomial time algorithm for approximating
the value of finitely ambiguous probabilistic automata and a
quasi-polynomial time algorithm for the emptiness problem for
$2$-ambiguous probabilistic automata.

                                        <i>The value 1 problem is a decision problem for probabilistic automata over finite words:
                                        given a probabilistic automaton, are there words accepted with probability arbitrarily close to 1?
                                        This problem was proved undecidable recently; to overcome this, several classes of probabilistic automata of different nature were proposed, 
                                        for which the value 1 problem has been shown decidable.
                                        In this paper, we introduce yet another class of probabilistic automata, called \textit{leaktight automata}, 
                                        which strictly subsumes all classes of probabilistic automata whose value 1 problem is known to be decidable.
                                        <br/>
                                        We prove that for leaktight automata, the value 1 problem is decidable (in fact, PSPACE-complete) by constructing 
                                        a saturation algorithm based on the computation of a monoid abstracting the behaviours of the automaton.
                                        We rely on algebraic techniques developed by Simon to prove that this abstraction is complete.
                                        Furthermore, we adapt this saturation algorithm to decide whether an automaton is leaktight.
                                        <br/>
                                        Finally, we show a reduction allowing to extend our decidability results from finite words to infinite ones, 
                                        implying that the value 1 problem for probabilistic leaktight parity automata is decidable.

                                        <i>The value 1 problem is a decision problem for probabilistic automata over finite words: 
                                        given a probabilistic automaton, are there words accepted with probability arbitrarily close to 1? 
                                        This problem was proved undecidable recently. 
                                        We sharpen this result, showing that the undecidability result holds even if the probabilistic automata have only one probabilistic transition. 
                                        Our main contribution is to introduce a new class of probabilistic automata, called leaktight automata, for which the value 1 problem is shown decidable 
                                        (and PSPACE-complete). 
                                        We construct an algorithm based on the computation of a monoid abstracting the behaviours of the automaton, 
                                        and rely on algebraic techniques developed by Simon for the correctness proof. 
                                        The class of leaktight automata is decidable in PSPACE, subsumes all subclasses of probabilistic automata whose value 1 problem is known to be decidable 
                                        (in particular deterministic automata), and is closed under two natural composition operators.

                                        <i>We consider the emptiness problem for alternating parity tree automata, with two acceptance semantics: classical (all branches are accepted) and qualitative 
                                        (almost all branches are accepted). 
                                        <br/>
                                        For the classical semantics, the usual technique to tackle this problem first removes alternation, going to non-determinism, 
                                        and then checks emptiness by a reduction to a two-player perfect-information parity game. 
                                        <br/>
                                        Our first contribution is to give an alternative roadmap to this problem by directly reducing the emptiness problem to 
                                        solving an imperfect-information two-player parity game.

                                        For the qualitative semantics, no simulation of alternation by means of non-determinism is known; yet our new approach can successfully be applied. 
                                        The key ingredient in the proof is a positionality result for stochastic games played on infinite arenas.

Program synthesis constructs programs from specifications in an automated way. 
Strategy Logic (SL) is a powerful and versatile specification language whose goal is to give theoretical foundations for program synthesis in a multi-agent setting. 
One limitation of Strategy Logic is that it is purely qualitative. 
For instance it cannot specify quantitative properties of executions such as ''every request is quickly granted'', 
or quantitative properties of trees such as ''most executions of the system terminate''. 
<br/>
In this work, we extend Strategy Logic to include quantitative aspects in a way that can express bounds on ''how quickly'' and ''how many''. 
We define Prompt Strategy Logic, which encompasses Prompt LTL (itself an extension of LTL with a prompt eventuality temporal operator), 
and we define Bounded-Outcome Strategy Logic which has a bounded quantifier on paths. 
We supply a general technique, based on the study of automata with counters, that solves the model-checking problems for both these logics.

In combination with game theoretic techniques, this also yields a simple description of an optimal procedure of history-determinisation for cost automata, a central result in the theory of regular cost functions.

                                        <i>The class of omega-regular languages provides a robust specification language in verification. 
                                        Every omega-regular condition can be decomposed into a safety part and a liveness part. 
                                        The liveness part ensures that something good happens "eventually". 
                                        Finitary liveness was proposed by Alur and Henzinger as a stronger formulation of liveness. 
                                        It requires that there exists an unknown, fixed bound b such that something good happens within b transitions. 
                                        In this work we consider automata with finitary acceptance conditions defined by finitary Buchi, parity and Streett languages. 
                                        We study languages expressible by such automata: we give their topological complexity and present a regular-expression characterization. 
                                        We compare the expressive power of finitary automata and give optimal algorithms for classical decisions questions. 
                                        We show that the finitary languages are Sigma 2-complete; we present a complete picture of the expressive power of various classes of automata with finitary 
                                        and infinitary acceptance conditions; 
                                        we show that the languages defined by finitary parity automata exactly characterize the star-free fragment of omega B-regular languages; 
                                        and we show that emptiness is NLOGSPACE-complete and universality as well as language inclusion are PSPACE-complete for finitary parity and Streett automata.

                                        <i>We present Stamina, a tool solving three algorithmic problems in automata theory.
First, compute the star height of a regular language, i.e. the minimal number of nested Kleene stars needed for expressing the language 
with a complement-free regular expression.
Second, decide limitedness for regular cost functions.
Third, decide whether a probabilistic leaktight automaton has value 1, i.e. whether a probabilistic leaktight automaton 
accepts words with probability arbitrarily close to 1.
<br/>
All three problems reduce to the computation of the stabilisation monoid associated with an automaton, 
which is computationally challenging because the monoid is exponentially larger than the automaton.
The compact data structures used in Stamina, together with optimisations and heuristics, allow us to handle automata with several hundreds of states.
This radically improves upon the performances of ACME, a similar tool solving a subset of these problems.
<br/>
The tool Stamina is open source and available from Github, details are given on the <a href="http://stamina.labri.fr">dedicated webpage</a>.

To go beyond the class of regular languages, we consider infinite automata and the notion of state complexity defined by Karp. We look at alternating automata as introduced by Chandra, Kozen and Stockmeyer: such machines run independent computations on the word and gather their answers through boolean combinations.
<br/>
We devise a lower bound technique relying on boundedly generated lattices of languages, and give two applications of this technique. The first is a hierarchy theorem, stating that there are languages of arbitrarily high polynomial alternating state complexity, and the second is a linear lower bound on the alternating state complexity of the prime numbers written in binary. This second result strengthens a result of Hartmanis and Shank from 1968, which implies an exponentially worse lower bound for the same model.

Semi-Markov processes are Markovian processes in which the firing time of the transitions is modelled by probabilistic distributions over positive reals interpreted as the probability of firing a transition at a certain moment in time. In this paper we consider the trace-based semantics of semi-Markov processes, and investigate the question of how to compare two semi-Markov processes with respect to their time-dependent behaviour. To this end, we introduce the relation of being "faster than" between processes and study its algorithmic complexity. Through a connection to probabilistic automata we obtain hardness results showing in particular that this relation is undecidable. However, we present an additive approximation algorithm for a time-bounded variant of the faster-than problem over semi-Markov processes with slow residence-time functions, and a coNP algorithm for the exact faster-than problem over unambiguous semi-Markov processes.

Labelled Markov processes are probabilistic versions of labelled transition systems. In general,
the state space of a labelled Markov process may be a continuum. Logical characterizations of
probabilistic bisimulation and simulation were given by Desharnais et al. These results hold for
systems defined on analytic state spaces and assume that there are countably many labels in the
case of bisimulation and finitely many labels in the case of simulation.
<br/>
In this paper, we first revisit these results by giving simpler and more streamlined proofs. In
particular, our proof for simulation has the same structure as the one for bisimulation, relying on
a new result of a topological nature. This departs from the known proof for this result, which uses
domain theoretic techniques and falls out of a theory of approximation of labelled Markov processes.
We also propose a new notion of event simulation.
<br/>
Our proofs assume the presence of countably many labels. We investigate the necessity of
this assumption, and show that the logical characterization of bisimulation may fail when there
are uncountably many labels. However, with a stronger assumption on the transition functions
(continuity instead of just measurability), we can regain the logical characterization result, for
arbitrarily many labels. These new results arose from a new game-theoretic way of understanding
probabilistic simulation and bisimulation.

                                        <i>Given two labelled Markov decision processes (MDPs), the trace-refinement problem asks whether for all strategies of the first MDP there exists a strategy of the second MDP such that the induced labelled Markov chains are trace-equivalent. We show that this problem is decidable in polynomial time if the second MDP is a Markov chain. The algorithm is based on new results on a particular notion of bisimulation between distributions over the states. However, we show that the general trace-refinement problem is undecidable, even if the first MDP is a Markov chain. Decidability of those problems has been open since 2008. We further study the decidability and complexity of the trace-refinement problem provided that the strategies are restricted to be memoryless.

We consider the decidability of state-to-state reachability in linear time-invariant control systems, with control sets defined by boolean combinations of linear inequalities. Decidability of the sub-problem in which control sets are linear subspaces is a fundamental result in control theory. We first show that reachability is undecidable if the set of controls is a finite union of affine subspaces. We then consider two simple subclasses of control sets---unions of two affine subspaces and bounded convex polytopes respectively---and show that in these two cases the reachability problem for LTI systems is as hard as certain longstanding open decision problems concerning linear recurrence sequences. Finally we present some spectral assumptions on the transition matrix of an LTI system under which reachability becomes decidable with bounded convex polytopes as control sets.

Our results imply that the class of closed semialgebraic invariants is closure-complete: there exists a closed semialgebraic invariant if and only if y is not in the topological closure of the orbit of x under A.

It is worth noting that the existence of semilinear invariants, on the other hand, is (to the best of our knowledge) not known to be decidable.
