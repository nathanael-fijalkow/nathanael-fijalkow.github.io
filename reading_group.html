<b>Meetings:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Thursday 28 November, 10am-12am, amphitheatre. <a href="https://jill-jenn.net/">Jill-Jênn Vie</a>, recommender systems and factorisation.

Abstract: Factorization is at the core of many applications: recommender systems, signal processing, personalized education. In this tutorial, we will dive into four different aspects of factorization: latent factor models in collaborative filtering, factorization machines and polynomial kernels, binary factorization and deep factorization. We will highlight the main techniques used and their limitations, and will open up to broader classes of models.

	<li>Monday 9th December. <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/hf323/">Hamza Fawzi</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01681.pdf">learning dynamic polynomial proofs</a>.
