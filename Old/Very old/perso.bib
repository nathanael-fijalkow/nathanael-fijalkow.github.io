  url_Abstract  = {The Orbit Problem consists of determining, given a linear transformation A on Q^d, together with vectors x and y, 
  whether the orbit of x under repeated applications of A can ever reach y. This problem was famously shown to be decidable by Kannan and Lipton in the 1980s.
<br/>
  In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of synthesising suitable invariants P included in R^d, i.e., sets that are stable under A and contain x and not y, 
  thereby providing compact and versatile certificates of non-reachability. 
  We show that whether a given instance of the Orbit Problem admits a semialgebraic invariant is decidable, and moreover in positive instances
  we provide an algorithm to synthesise suitable invariants of polynomial size.
<br/>
  It is worth noting that the existence of semilinear invariants, on the other hand, is (to the best of our knowledge) not known to be decidable.},

  url_Abstract  = {Labelled Markov processes are probabilistic versions of labelled
  transition systems.  In general, the state space of a labelled Markov
  process may be a continuum.  Logical characterizations of probabilistic
  bisimulation and simulation were given by Desharnais et al.  These
  results hold for systems defined on analytic state spaces and
  assume that there are countably many labels in the case of bisimulation
  and finitely many labels in the case of simulation.
<br/>
  In this paper, we first revisit these results by giving simpler and more
  streamlined proofs.  In particular, our proof for simulation has the same
  structure as the one for bisimulation, relying on a new result of a
  topological nature.  This departs from the known proof
  for this result, which uses domain theory techniques and falls out of a
  theory of approximation of Labelled Markov processes.
<br/>
  Both our proofs assume the presence of countably many labels.  We
  investigate the necessity of this assumption, and show that the
  logical characterization of bisimulation may fail when there are
  uncountably many labels.  However, with a stronger assumption on the
  transition functions (continuity instead of just measurability), we can
  regain the logical characterization result, for arbitrarily many labels.
  These new results arose from a new game-theoretic way of understanding
  probabilistic simulation and bisimulation.},
