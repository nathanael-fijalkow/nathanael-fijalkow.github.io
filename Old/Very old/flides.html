<h2>Flides</h2>

<p>
Flides allows to create sets of slides in HTML5, using javascript.

<p>
The core visualisation features (zoom in particular) is based on <a href="http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/">impress.js</a>. I added some features:
<ul>
	<li> slide steps, allowing to display slides by small bits (using 'right'), with a quick mode ('down') 
	<li> navigational shortcuts: 'enter' for going ot the overview and 'backspace' for going to the beginning,
	<li> always visible slides,
	<li> animation using SVG,
	<li> partial overviews, showing what was already seen but not what is coming after,
	<li> clickable / not clickable slides...
</ul>

<p>
You can check out this <a href="Talk/Demo_Flides">basic demo</a> I made, and download <a href="Talk/Demo_Flides/Demo_Flides.tar.gz">the (commented) sources</a>.

Here is a complete example: <a href="Talk/2016-01-20-Oxford_Verification_State_Complexity">the slides for a seminar in Oxford</a>.

<p>
If you have troubles visualising them:
<ul> 
	<li> If you see nothing: you are using a too old browser which did not yet implement the latest HTML5 features used there, or you did not enable javascript. I can do nothing for you.</li>
	<li> If it's slow and laggy: you may want to try Google Chrome, as it's definitely the best browser for this.</li>
	<li> If some parts of the slides do not fit the windows: it's because you use a zoom in your browser, play with it (usually, setting it to between 67% and 100% works just fine).</li>
</ul>

<b>All</b> comments and questions are most welcome! I'd be very glad to help you making HTML5 slides.
