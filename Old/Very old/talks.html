				<i>
The study of bisimulation for Markov Decision Processes is
a well established topic within the LICS community, where the
original motivations and questions come from programming
languages and concurrency. It also has potential applications
for reinforcement learning, which seem to be so far not deeply
explored. The objective of this abstract is to open a discussion
on the topic at the Workshop LearnAut 2017, starting from
recent works on bisimulation on distributions. There are many
promising directions to look at, including comparing to the
classical notion of probabilistic bisimulation, and considering
distances instead of equivalence relations.

				Probabilistic automata are a computational model introduced by Michael Rabin, extending non-deterministic finite automata with probabilistic transitions. 
				Despite its simplicity, this model is very expressive and many of the associated algorithmic questions are undecidable. 
				In this work we focus on the emptiness problem, which asks whether a given probabilistic automaton accepts some word with probability higher than a given threshold. 
				We consider a natural and well-studied structural restriction on automata, namely the degree of ambiguity, which is defined as the maximum number of accepting runs over all 					words. We observe that undecidability of the emptiness problem requires infinite ambiguity and so we focus on the case of finitely ambiguous probabilistic automata.
				<br/><br/>
				Our main results are to construct efficient algorithms for analysing finitely ambiguous probabilistic automata through a reduction to a multi-objective optimisation
				problem, called the stochastic path problem. We obtain a polynomial time algorithm for approximating the value of finitely ambiguous probabilistic automata and 
				a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for the emptiness problem for 2-ambiguous probabilistic automata.

				<i>Since I started my PhD, I already spoke twice at this seminar about the value 1 problem for probabilistic automata. This talk shall be the last on this topic, 
				as it hopefully answers the initial question: "what is computable about the value 1 problem?".
				<br/>
				The first time, I explained that the value 1 problem is undecidable, that we have an algorithm, called the Markov Monoid Algorithm (MMA), and a subclass of probabilistic 					automata, the leaktight automata, such that the MMA correctly solves the value 1 problem for leaktight automata.
				<br/>
				The second time, I explained that relaxing the value 1 problem by abstracting away the numerical values does not lead to decidability.
				<br/>
				This time, I will formalize the following claim: "the MMA is optimal". Inspired by Szymon Torunczyk's PhD thesis, 
				I will develop a theory of prostochastic words borrowing ideas from the profinite approach in automata theory. 
				This new formulation allows for a simple characterization of the MMA, as well as a new undecidability result that shows that undecidability is around the corner, 
				supporting the claim that the MMA is optimal.

				<i>In this talk, I will present some recent work on the value 1 problem for probabilistic automata over finite words: given a probabilistic automaton, 
				are there words accepted with probability arbitrarily close to 1?
				<br/>
				This problem was proved undecidable recently. However, it shows some similarities with another problem, the boundedness problem for distance automata, 
				which was shown decidable by Hashiguchi in 1982. 
				Initially derived from a very long and complicated proof, this decidability result has been considerably simplified, the major steps being an algebraic 				algorithm proposed by Leung in 1991 and algebraic techniques developed by Simon in 1990 and 1994. 
				The decidability result was later extended to nested desert distance automata and conceptually simplified by Kirsten in 2005.
				<br/>
				We have transferred the underlying ideas to probabilistic automata. Our main contribution is to introduce a new class of probabilistic automata, called leaktight automata, 					for which the value 1 problem is shown decidable (and PSPACE-complete). We construct an algorithm based on the computation of a monoid 
				abstracting the behaviors of the automaton, following Leung's algorithm. As in the case of distance automata, the correctness proof relies on the algebraic techniques 					developed by Simon, namely factorization and decomposition trees.

			<div id="abstractlogicsboundedness" class="collapse">
				<i>Over the last 10 years, different extensions of Monadic Second-Order Logic (MSO) have been introduced and studied that allow to express boundedness properties, 
				for instance MSO + U (introduced by Mikolaj Bojanczyk) and cost MSO (introduced by Thomas Colcombet). 
				It turned out to be a fertile area of research, leading to a theory comprising new models of automata, algebraic representations and decidability results. 
				Although many positive results are known in the case of (finite or infinite) words, extending them to infinite trees seems to be very challenging. 
				<br/>
				In this talk, I will survey the recent results in this direction, and focus on our recent result, which is a simulation theorem for alternating B-automata.

			<div id="abstractfinitarygames" class="collapse">
				<i>We study two-player zero-sum games over infinite-state graphs equipped with omega-B and finitary conditions. 
				Our first contribution is about the strategy complexity, i.e the memory required for winning strategies: we prove that over general infinite-state graphs, memoryless 					strategies are sufficient for finitary Büchi, and finite-memory suffices for finitary parity games. 
				<br/>
				We then study pushdown games with boundedness conditions, with two contributions. First we prove a collapse result for pushdown games with omega-B-conditions, implying the 					decidability of solving these games. Second we consider pushdown games with finitary parity along with stack boundedness conditions, and show that solving these games is 					EXPTIME-complete.

				<i>In this talk, I will discuss some recent developments about boundedness games, which appear in different contexts, 
				for instance in the study of regular cost-functions as defined by Thomas Colcombet.
				<br/>
				They are two-player games featuring counters that can be incremented, reset of left unchanged, 
				and where the first player's objective is that the counters remain bounded along the play. 
				They can be played over finite graphs or infinite graphs, for instance over pushdown graphs. 

				I am interested in the following questions: deciding the winner, proving the existence of finite-memory strategies, and constructing such strategies.

			<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#abstractcostparity">Display/Hide the abstract</button>
			<div id="abstractcostparity" class="collapse">
				<i>The starting point of this work is the following observation: 
				although similar in flavor, parity games and finitary parity games are very different from an algorithmic perspective. 
				Both are two-player games on graphs whose vertices are labeled by integers. 
				The parity winning condition states that almost all odd labels are followed by a greater even label. 
				Parity games have received a lot of attention since they are the model-checking games of the modal mu-calculus and determining the winner in a parity game 
				is one of the few problems in NP and co-NP, but not known to be in PTIME. 
				<br/>
				The finitary parity condition is obtained by additionally requiring a bound on the number of edges traversed between odd labels and the next greater even label. 
				Quite surprisingly, deciding the winner in a finitary parity game can be carried out in polynomial time.
				</br>
				This work generalizes both parity games and finitary parity games by introducing cost-parity games. 
				In these games traversing an edge comes with a cost and the condition requires a bound on the cost between odd labels and the next greater even label. 
				We show that cost-parity games enjoy two nice properties of parity and finitary parity games: the first player has memoryless winning strategies, 
				and determining the winner lies in NP and co-NP (as for parity games). 
				Furthermore, we show that solving cost-parity games can be algorithmically reduced to solving parity games, 
				which allows to solve cost-parity games almost as efficiently as parity games.

				Moreover, we consider the memory requirements for both players and give matching upper and lower bounds on the size of winning strategies.

				<i>Games on graphs provide a natural model for reactive non-terminating systems.

				Different settings are used to model various open systems in computer science, as for instance turn-based or concurrent moves, and deterministic or stochastic transitions. 					In this paper, we are interested in turn-based games, and specifically in deterministic parity games and stochastic reachability games 
				(also known as simple stochastic games). We present a simple, direct and efficient reduction from deterministic parity games to simple stochastic games: 
				it yields an arena whose size is linear up to a logarithmic factor in size of the original arena.

				<i>The class of omega-regular languages provides a robust specification language in verification. 
				Every omega-regular condition can be decomposed into a safety part and a liveness part. 
				The liveness part ensures that something good happens "eventually". 
				Finitary liveness was proposed by Alur and Henzinger as a stronger formulation of liveness. 
				It requires that there exists an unknown, fixed bound b such that something good happens within b transitions. 
				In this work we consider automata with finitary acceptance conditions defined by finitary Buchi, parity and Streett languages. 
				We study languages expressible by such automata: we give their topological complexity and present a regular-expression characterization. 
				We compare the expressive power of finitary automata and give optimal algorithms for classical decisions questions. 
				We show that the finitary languages are Sigma 2-complete; we present a complete picture of the expressive power of various classes of automata 
				with finitary and infinitary acceptance conditions; we show that the languages defined by finitary parity automata 
				exactly characterize the star-free fragment of omega B-regular languages; 
				and we show that emptiness is NLOGSPACE-complete and universality as well as language inclusion are PSPACE-complete for finitary parity and Streett automata.
