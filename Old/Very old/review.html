<h2>I sign (most of) my reviews. I explain my motivations for doing so.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Disclaimer</b>: I do NOT believe that everyone should do this. I list here my personal reasons, which may or may not apply to others.</h3>
<br>
<br>
Signing a review gives me an imperative to be <b>factual</b>, <b>constructive</b>, and gives <b>more importance</b> to my reviews:
<ul>
	<li><b>factual</b>: I think reviews should focus on facts from which one derives opinions (such as accept / reject).
	I do not write opinions like "I do not like this line of work", or "this result is uninteresting", because I do not think this is the role of reviewing.
	Signing a review forces me to stick to opinions grounded on facts.

	<li><b>constructive</b>: I like to think of the reviewer as a champion for the paper. 
	In other words, when I review a paper I am defending it, and look for the positive aspects of it before the negative ones.
	I discuss in my review both aspects and try to be constructive about the issues.
	<br/>
	This is how society works when people do not hide behind anonymity to give their opinions.
	
	<li><b>importance</b>: I believe that signing makes my review stronger. Because I stand for what I write, 
	I claim that I did a serious job understanding the paper and I ask for my opinion on the paper to be considered.
</ul>
Another outcome of signing a review is to be recognised for it. 
I sometimes get some new interactions with authors of papers I have reviewed, who contact me about possible directions triggered by the review.
This is my returns on the time invested in reviewing.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are two risks: <b>antagonising other researchers</b> and <b>not being truthful</b>. This is where I apply my own judgment: 
<ul>
	<li>If I think a person may not be reasonable enough to take a criticism, I do not sign the review;
	<li>If I think I would not be truthful signing the review (being either more positive or more negative than I would otherwise), I do not sign the review.
</ul>
In practice I most often sign my reviews.
