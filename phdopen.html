<h3>PhD Open</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
Open lectures for PhD students in computer science, organized at LaBRI, is a project which aims at offering research level but introductory courses given by top researchers from all over the world.
Supported by the <a href="?page=deepsynth">Momentum DeepSynth project</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Organised by Nathana&euml;l Fijalkow and <a href="http://www.labri.fr/perso/jochremiak/">Joanna Ochremiak</a>.

Many distributed algorithms should be correct independently of the number of processes executing them. Examples include algorithms for mutual exclusion, leader election, distributed termination, distributed consensus, reliable broadcast, etc. We say that these systems are parametric in the
number of processes, and call them parameterized systems.
	<br/>
	<br/>
When the number of processes is fixed, many parameterized systems have a finite state space, and their correctness can be automatically analyzed using e.g. model-checking techniques. The challenge of parameterized verifciation is to automatically prove correctness for any number of processes. It amounts to proving that each member of an infinite family of finite-state systems
is correct.

Population protocols are a model of computation very much studied by the distributed systems community. They are used to describe and analyze algorithms able to run in arbitrary networks of unknown topology. The goal of a protocol is that all processes learn some information about the
initial configuration of the network.
	<br/>
	<br/>
Population protocols are a great testbed for parameterized verification techniques.
In the course we will introduce them, discuss their expressive power, and analyze the theory and practice of proving them correct. The lectures will make extensive use of Peregrine, a tool for the simulation, analysis and verification of population protocols.
