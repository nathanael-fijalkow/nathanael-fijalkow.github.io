					<i>This thesis is a contribution to the study of quantitative models of automata, and more specifically of automata with counters and probabilistic automata. They have been independently studied for decades, leading to deep theoretical insights of practical value.
<br/>

We investigate here two seemingly unrelated questions, the first about finite-memory determinacy for boundedness games, and the second about the value 1 problem for probabilistic automata. Some of the results are obtained by transferring techniques and ideas from one model to the other, revealing some connections between them.
<br/>
<br/>


The first part of this document investigates finite-memory determinacy for boundedness games, which is motivated by, and belongs to, a research program launched ten years ago by Bojanczyk and Colcombet, aiming at understanding boundedness logics; the so-called MSO + U and cost-MSO. These two logics induce two related models of games with counters, for which we show both positive and negative results about their finite-memory determinacy.
<br/>

The main motivation for this investigation is the LoCo conjecture, stated by Colcombet and Loeding in 2010, and shown to imply the decidability of cost-MSO over infinite trees, which is the main open problem of this research program.
We show that unfortunately the LoCo conjecture does not hold. On the positive side, we show a weaker statement: the LoCo conjecture holds for all thin tree arenas.

<br/>
<br/>


The second part of this document is about the value 1 problem for probabilistic automata. The starting point is the undecidability of this problem, which was proved in 2010 by Gimbert and Oualhadj. The aim of the results presented here is to understand to what extent is the value 1 problem undecidable, by constructing an algorithm that partially solves it and arguing that it is in some sense optimal.

<br/>
The first step is the construction of the Markov Monoid algorithm, inspired by the notion of stabilisation monoids as introduced by Colcombet in the study of cost-MSO. We first prove that it is correct for a subclass of probabilistic automata that we define, called leaktight automata, relying on the notion of factorisation trees as developed by Imre Simon. We then show that all subclasses for which the value 1 problem was shown to be decidable are leaktight, implying that this algorithm is so far the best known algorithm.

<br/>
The second step aims at better understanding the Markov Monoid algorithm, using a new framework that we introduce, called the prostochastic theory. The prostochastic theory is a topological approach for probabilistic automata inspired by the profinite theory as developed by Almeida, Pin, Weil and others for classical automata, and used by Torunczyk for the study of MSO + U. In this context, the value 1 problem reformulates at an emptiness problem, providing theoretical foundations for reasoning about the Markov Monoid algorithm. Our main result is to give a characterisation of the Markov Monoid algorithm using the prostochastic theory. It says that the Markov Monoid algorithm captures exactly all polynomial behaviours; the undecidability result shows that combining polynomial and exponential behaviours leads to undecidability. The combination of these two results supports the claim that the Markov Monoid algorithm is optimal.

Semi-Markov processes are Markovian processes in which the firing time of the transitions is modelled by probabilistic distributions over positive reals interpreted as the probability of firing a transition at a certain moment in time. In this paper we consider the trace-based semantics of semi-Markov processes, and investigate the question of how to compare two semi-Markov processes with respect to their time-dependent behaviour. To this end, we introduce the relation of being "faster than" between processes and study its algorithmic complexity. Through a connection to probabilistic automata we obtain hardness results showing in particular that this relation is undecidable. However, we present an additive approximation algorithm for a time-bounded variant of the faster-than problem over semi-Markov processes with slow residence-time functions, and a coNP algorithm for the exact faster-than problem over unambiguous semi-Markov processes.

  Probabilistic automata are a computational model introduced by
  Michael Rabin, extending nondeterministic finite automata with
  probabilistic transitions.  Despite its simplicity, this model is
  very expressive and many of the associated algorithmic questions are
  undecidable.  In this work we focus on the emptiness problem, which
  asks whether a given probabilistic automaton accepts some word with
  probability higher than a given threshold.  We consider a natural
  and well-studied structural restriction on automata, namely the
  degree of ambiguity, which is defined as the maximum number of
  accepting runs over all words.  We observe that undecidability of
  the emptiness problem requires infinite ambiguity and so we focus on
  the case of finitely ambiguous probabilistic automata.
<br/>
  Our main results are to construct efficient algorithms for analysing
  finitely ambiguous probabilistic automata through a reduction to a
  multi-objective optimisation problem, called the stochastic path
  problem.  We obtain a polynomial time algorithm for approximating
  the value of finitely ambiguous probabilistic automata and a
  quasi-polynomial time algorithm for the emptiness problem for
  $2$-ambiguous probabilistic automata.

  Labelled Markov processes are probabilistic versions of labelled
  transition systems.  In general, the state space of a labelled Markov
  process may be a continuum.  Logical characterizations of probabilistic
  bisimulation and simulation were given by Desharnais et al.  These
  results hold for systems defined on analytic state spaces and
  assume that there are countably many labels in the case of bisimulation
  and finitely many labels in the case of simulation.
<br/>
  In this paper, we first revisit these results by giving simpler and more
  streamlined proofs.  In particular, our proof for simulation has the same
  structure as the one for bisimulation, relying on a new result of a
  topological nature.  This departs from the known proof
  for this result, which uses domain theory techniques and falls out of a
  theory of approximation of Labelled Markov processes.
<br/>
  Both our proofs assume the presence of countably many labels.  We
  investigate the necessity of this assumption, and show that the
  logical characterization of bisimulation may fail when there are
  uncountably many labels.  However, with a stronger assumption on the
  transition functions (continuity instead of just measurability), we can
  regain the logical characterization result, for arbitrarily many labels.
  These new results arose from a new game-theoretic way of understanding
  probabilistic simulation and bisimulation.

					<i>We present Stamina, a tool solving three algorithmic problems in automata theory.
First, compute the star height of a regular language, i.e. the minimal number of nested Kleene stars needed for expressing the language 
with a complement-free regular expression.
Second, decide limitedness for regular cost functions.
Third, decide whether a probabilistic leaktight automaton has value 1, i.e. whether a probabilistic leaktight automaton 
accepts words with probability arbitrarily close to 1.
<br/>
All three problems reduce to the computation of the stabilisation monoid associated with an automaton, 
which is computationally challenging because the monoid is exponentially larger than the automaton.
The compact data structures used in Stamina, together with optimisations and heuristics, allow us to handle automata with several hundreds of states.
This radically improves upon the performances of ACME, a similar tool solving a subset of these problems.

					<i>The Orbit Problem consists of determining, given a linear transformation A on Q^d, together with vectors x and y, whether the orbit of x under repeated applications of A can ever reach y. This problem was famously shown to be decidable by Kannan and Lipton in the 1980s.

In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of synthesising suitable invariants P included in R^d, i.e., sets that are stable under A and contain x and not y, thereby providing compact and versatile certificates of non-reachability. 
We show that whether a given instance of the Orbit Problem admits a semialgebraic invariant is decidable, and moreover in positive instances we provide an algorithm to synthesise suitable invariants of polynomial size.

It is worth noting that the existence of semilinear invariants, on the other hand, is (to the best of our knowledge) not known to be decidable.

The algorithm is based on new results on a particular notion of bisimulation between distributions over the states.

					<i>We consider the emptiness problem for alternating parity tree automata, with two acceptance semantics: classical (all branches are accepted) and qualitative 
					(almost all branches are accepted). 
					<br/>
					For the classical semantics, the usual technique to tackle this problem first removes alternation, going to non-determinism, 
					and then checks emptiness by a reduction to a two-player perfect-information parity game. 
					<br/>
					Our first contribution is to give an alternative roadmap to this problem by directly reducing the emptiness problem to 
					solving an imperfect-information two-player parity game. 
					<br/>
					For the qualitative semantics, no simulation of alternation by means of non-determinism is known; yet our new approach can successfully be applied. 
					The key ingredient in the proof is a positionality result for stochastic games played on infinite arenas.

We consider the value 1 problem for probabilistic automata over finite words:
it asks whether a given probabilistic automaton accepts words with probability arbitrarily close to 1.
This problem is known to be undecidable.
However, different algorithms have been proposed to partially solve it;
it has been recently shown that the Markov Monoid algorithm, based on algebra, 
is the most correct algorithm so far.
The first contribution of this paper is to give a characterisation of the Markov Monoid algorithm.
<br/>
The second contribution is to develop a profinite theory for probabilistic automata, called the prostochastic theory.
This new framework gives a topological account of the value 1 problem,
which in this context is cast as an emptiness problem.
The above characterisation is reformulated using the prostochastic theory, allowing us to give a simple and modular proof.
